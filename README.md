# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The PyBer analysis in Module 5 was a way for us to apply and test our knowledge of using panda dataframes, pivot tables, and data charts in Python. We continued our use of CSV files to retrieve data. For this challenge, we merged two files into one data frame in order to see the variation of ride sharing data across three different types of cities: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.

Once we pulled in all of our data, we calculated the average fares for the diffferent types of cities as well as the average fares per driver. Although this information can be visualized in a pivot table or data frame, it may be more useful for the reader if it is in a chart format. 

## Results
In order to get the metrics mentioned above, we had to first retrieve the total driver count. Utilizing the count formula, these metrics were grouped by the three different city types. There were 125 Rural rides, 625 Suburban rides, and 1,625 Urban rides. It's clear that the Urban city type has the highest demand for PyBer. The driver count correlated with the ride count. The Urban type cities had the most drivers and the Rural type cities had the lowest count.

An interesting finding was the average fare per ride. The Urban type cities' average fares was under $25, and the Rural type cities' average fare was almost $35. Additionally, there were an even wider gap between the average fare per driver.

## Summary
These disparaties amongst the differenty city types should certainly be brought to the CEO's attention. Three business recommendations that I have for the CEO would be to add in data about the miles per trip. Understanding how far each type is may help the company better understand the data. If the urban rides are short distances, it would make sense that their fares are lower. If the rural rides are much longer distances, their higher fare rate would be justified. I'd also be interested in looking at cross-city-type data. How are rides classified as rural vs. urban vs. suburban? If a rider goes from an urban area to a rural area, how is the trip classified? I would recommend looking at that data as well.
