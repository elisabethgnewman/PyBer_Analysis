# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The PyBer analysis in Module 5 was a way for us to apply and test our knowledge of using panda dataframes, pivot tables, and data charts in Python. We continued our use of CSV files to retrieve data. For this challenge, we merged two files into one data frame in order to see the variation of ride sharing data across three different types of cities: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.

Once we pulled in all of our data, we calculated the average fares for the diffferent types of cities as well as the average fares per driver. Although this information can be visualized in a pivot table or data frame, it may be more useful for the reader if it is in a chart format.
